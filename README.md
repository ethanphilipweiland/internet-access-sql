# Exploring World Internet Access Using SQL
I use PostgreSQL to answer five questions about internet access around the world. The dataset used contains information on internet access, telephone landline connections, broadband internet landline connections, and mobile subscriptions for each country every year for the past few decades. I use SQL techniques like aggregations, joining, window functions, common table expressions, and subqueries to answer five questions using this dataset, providing a data-informed picture of global internet access.

## Analytical Report
The file "notebook.ipynb" contains an overview of this project and all SQL code. Specifically, it details the purpose, data, analysis questions, SQL queries, and results.

## File Descriptions
    1. /Data/ : Folder containing the two data files "adoption.csv" and "internet_users.csv"
    2. notebook.ipynb : Details the purpose, data, and analysis questions as well as the SQL code and the results of the queries.
